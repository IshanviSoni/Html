<p><b>Abraham Lincoln became the United States’ 16th President in 1861, issuing the Emancipation</b></p><p><b> Proclamation that declared forever free those slaves within the Confederacy in 1863.</b></p>
<p>Lincoln warned the South in his Inaugural Address:<b><i>. “In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war.</i></b> The government will not assail you…,</p>
…. You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it.”</p>

<p><u>Lincoln thought secession illegal, and was willing to use force to defend Federal law and the Union. When Confederate batteries fired on Fort Sumter and forced its surrender, he called on the states for 75,000</u> volunteers. Four more slave states joined the Confederacy but four remained within the Union. The Civil War had begun.</p>
